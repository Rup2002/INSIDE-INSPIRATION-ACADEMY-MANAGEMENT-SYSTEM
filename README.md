# INSIDE-INSPIRATION-ACADEMY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
This is a Java-based application project for any type of Management System. Here we used Java, AWT, Swing and MySQL to complete this whole project. We used an ojdbc6 executable jar file and mysql-connector-java-8.0.30 initially to execute our project as we used MySQL here.
